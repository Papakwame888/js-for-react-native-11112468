Array and User Profile Manipulation

Student ID: [11112468]

Overview
This project consists of three main tasks that involve manipulating arrays and creating user profiles using JavaScript.

Task 1: Array Manipulation
- File: `arrayManipulation.js`
- Function: `processArray`
- Description: This function takes an array of numbers as an argument. It returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

Task 2: String Formatting Based on Processed Numbers
- File: `arrayManipulation.js`
- Function: `formatArrayStrings`
- Description: This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

 Task 3: Create User Profiles
-File: `userInfo.js`
-Function: `createUserProfiles`
-Description: This function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
